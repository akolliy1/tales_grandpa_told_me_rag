Listen here, kiddo. When you walk into that interview room, remember what I always told you - keep it simple, stupid. Don't try to be the smartest person in the room right off the bat. Start with something that works, then make it fancy if they ask. Most of these young hotshots try to impress with all sorts of complicated nonsense when a simple solution would do just fine.
Now, about this Django business you're always tinkering with - it's like my old toolshed. Everything you need is already in there, so don't go building your own hammer when there's a perfectly good one on the shelf. That's what they mean by 'batteries included,' son. Learn what's already there before you start reinventing the wheel.
And those Models of yours? Think of them like the foundation of a house. You get that foundation wrong, and everything else is gonna be crooked. Spend the time to get your data relationships right - trust me on this one.
As for your Python code, write it like your grandmother's gonna read it someday. Clean, neat, and no funny business. Use those fancy features when they make sense, not just to show off. I've seen too many young folks get clever for clever's sake.
This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) thing you keep talking about - it's like having a good filing system. If you can't find what you're looking for, doesn't matter how smart you are, you're still stuck. And always have a backup plan, because sometimes the filing cabinet is empty, and you still gotta give the customer an answer.
Remember, they're not just testing what you know - they're seeing if you're the kind of person they want to work with every day.
