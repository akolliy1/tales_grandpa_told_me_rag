Alright kiddo, let me tell you what I've learned from watching you work on all this computer stuff over the years.
When you go into those interviews, don't overthink it. I've seen you code - you're good at this. Just solve the problem step by step, like fixing an old radio. Get it working first, then make it pretty. These interviewers want to see you think through problems, not show off every trick you know.
Now, this Django framework you're always using - it's smart. It's like buying a car that already has air conditioning, radio, and GPS built in. Don't waste time building what's already there. Learn what Django gives you for free - the user login stuff, the admin panels, all of it. Use the tools you've got.
Your database design - that's like planning out the rooms in a house before you build it. Get those relationships between your data right from the start. I've watched you curse at your computer when you had to redo database stuff because you rushed that part.
Keep your Python code clean and readable. Write it like someone else has to maintain it after you're gone - because they will. Use those Python shortcuts when they make the code clearer, not just because you can.
This RAG thing - retrieval and generation - think of it like having a really good research assistant. If your assistant can't find the right information quickly, even the smartest person can't give good answers. Make sure your search and retrieval part works well, and always have a backup when it doesn't find anything useful.
Most importantly, remember they're hiring a person, not just a programmer. Be yourself, ask good questions, and show them you can work with a team.
